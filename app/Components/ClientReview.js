                    They were transparent about the time and the stages of the project. The end product is high quality, and I feel confident about how they were handholding the client through the process. I feel like I can introduce them to someone who needs to put a sales deck together from scratch, and they would be able to handhold the client experience from 0 to 100 very effectively from story to design. 5/5</p>
